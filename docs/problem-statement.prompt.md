HireAI: Talent Matchmaking
Problem
AI companies and enterprises struggle to fill specialized roles quickly. Scarcity of qualified candidates, manual sourcing, inefficient screening, and bias stretch the average time-to-hire past 60 days and push costs sky-high. An LLM-driven, natural-language search engine that understands skills, projects, and context promises to compress this cycle from weeks to minutes.

Solution
Build an end-to-end hiring copilot that lets recruiters type a plain-English request (e.g., 'Find senior Gen-AI engineers with LangChain + RAG experience in Europe, open to contract work') and instantly returns relevant candidates, auto-screens them, and sends personalized outreach.

Scope
Natural-language multi-source talent search ('PeopleGPT')
Auto resume parsing & skill extraction
Talent-pool insights dashboards (charts)
Candidate Ranking: Automatically ranks, scores, and organizes candidate profiles based on recruiter criteria, eliminating manual screening
Background Checking and Pre-Screening
Uses AI to verify candidate information and generate screening Q&A for assessment
Sends personalized outreach
