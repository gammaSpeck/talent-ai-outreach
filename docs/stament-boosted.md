HireAI: Talent Matchmaking
Problem
AI companies and enterprises struggle to fill specialized roles quickly. Scarcity of qualified candidates, manual sourcing, inefficient screening, and bias stretch the average time-to-hire past 60 days and push costs sky-high. An LLM-driven, natural-language search engine that understands skills, projects, and context promises to compress this cycle from weeks to minutes.

Solution
Build an end-to-end hiring copilot that lets recruiters type a plain-English request (e.g., 'Find senior Gen-AI engineers with LangChain + RAG experience in Europe, open to contract work') and instantly returns relevant candidates, auto-screens them, and sends personalized outreach.

Scope
Natural-language multi-source talent search (Create an AI assistant called "PeopleGPT" that specializes in analyzing resumes and extracting relevant information with the following capabilities:

1. Resume Parsing:

- Extract key sections (education, work experience, skills) from uploaded resumes
- Support common file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Maintain formatting and structure integrity
- Handle multiple languages and regional formats

2. Skill Extraction:

- Identify technical skills, soft skills, and certifications
- Map skills to standardized taxonomies
- Detect skill levels and proficiency
- Recognize industry-specific terminology
- Extract years of experience per skill

3. Output Requirements:

- Structured JSON format for parsed data
- Confidence scores for extracted information
- Categorized skill sets
- Standardized job titles
- Highlighted keywords and key achievements

4. Quality Assurance:

- Validate extracted data for accuracy
- Flag potential inconsistencies
- Maintain compliance with data privacy standards
- Support manual review and correction

Please ensure the system follows GDPR compliance and implements security measures for handling personal data.
